# Vertex3D
# ENGINE IS STILL BEING BUILT
## What is Vertex3D?
Vertex3D is a passion project, made for the purpose of learning how game engines work on the inside. Because of that reason, Vertex3D may not be stable for actual use. <br>
If you stumbled across this or wanted to test out what this engine can do, thank you :)
