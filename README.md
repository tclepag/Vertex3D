# Vertex3D
## What is Vertex3D?
Vertex3D is a passion project game engine that was made to learn how game engines were built.
This game engine hopes to achieve many features that most well-known game engines already have, whilst that is my goal, this engine may not be suitable for your needs. 
It may need refactoring, bug fixes and even completely rewriting parts of the engine. But If you chose to take a look at what I was able to create, and try it out for yourself, thank you :]

### Other Info
* Made with Jetbrains CLion (C++)
* CMake file automatically downloads GLM, GLAD, GLFW, ETC... to prevent the clutter and time-consuming process of downloading the right files
